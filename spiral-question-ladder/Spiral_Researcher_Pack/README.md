# Spiral Researcher Pack
Date: 2025-10-02

This pack lets independent researchers evaluate the **Spiral Question Ladder** without needing the creator’s ongoing involvement.

## 1) One-paragraph summary
Spiral Question Ladder is a five-layer inquiry scaffold—**Clarifying → Causal → Ethical → Transformational → Meta**—designed to shift thinking from answers to *reframing*. It is an **integrative** framework (not a new construct): the layers map to conceptual clarity, systems/causal reasoning, moral reasoning, redesign/innovation, and metacognition/epistemic cognition. The distinctive mechanism is **mandatory Ethics + Meta + Recursion** (loop-backs), which should increase **question depth, transfer, and redesign quality** in classrooms, teams, and dialogues.

## 2) Theory of change (text schematic)
- Input: 5-layer protocol + visible spiral map + light facilitation + time-boxed rounds.
- Mediators: recursive questioning; explicit ethics; frame awareness; shared artifact.
- Outcomes (near-term): higher **recursion, generativity, friction, layering** scores; improved systems reasoning; stronger metacognitive reflection.
- Outcomes (mid-term): better transfer to new problems; redesigned solutions; healthier meeting/dialogue norms.
- Boundary conditions: time limits; facilitator skill; content familiarity; psychological safety.

## 3) What’s inside
- **Instruments**: rubrics, anchors, fidelity checklist.
- **Protocols**: three study designs (classroom, teams, community).
- **Surveys & Consent**: adult/student templates.
- **Data kit**: data dictionary + tidy CSV templates.
- **Pre-registration**: checklists & hypotheses scaffold.
- **Recruitment & Admin**: emails, MoU, authorship & license.
- **Timeline & budget**: 8–12 week plan.
