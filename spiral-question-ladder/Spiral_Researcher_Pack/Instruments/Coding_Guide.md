# Coding Guide (Anchors & Examples)

## Definitions
- **Recursion**: References that loop back and refine earlier layers.
- **Generativity**: Extent to which questions open further inquiry.
- **Friction**: Presence of productive tension/discomfort.
- **Layering**: Distinct presence of Clarifying, Causal, Ethical, Transformational, Meta.
- **Meta-Index**: Explicit awareness of frames, assumptions, blind spots.

## Anchors
- Recursion=5 example: “Given our Ethical concern about equity, should we *redefine* our Clarifying term ‘access’?”
- Generativity=5 example: “What futures become possible if we invert the premise…”
- Friction=5 example: “Who pays for our convenience—and is that acceptable?”
- Layering=5 example: All five layers are present and labeled in the map.
- Meta-Index=5 example: “Why did we frame this as a tech problem and not a civic one?”

## Rater Calibration
- Score independently; discuss disagreements >1 point.
- Aim for Krippendorff’s alpha ≥ .67 on total score.
