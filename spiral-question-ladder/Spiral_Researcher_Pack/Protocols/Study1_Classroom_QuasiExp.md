# Study 1 — Classroom Quasi-Experiment (4 weeks)

## Design
Two matched sections (or classes). One uses **business-as-usual** (BAU), the other uses **Spiral** for two units.

## Sample
N≈50–120 students total. Subjects: science, literature, or social studies.

## Procedure
1) Baseline: collect BAU artifacts (discussion questions, exit tickets).
2) Intervention: 4 Spiral sessions (full 5 layers, 45–60 min each).
3) Post: collect spiral maps + assignments.
4) Blind-score artifacts with Spiral Rubric; collect a short student survey.

## Outcomes
- Primary: Total Spiral Rubric score; Layering present/absent.
- Secondary: Systems/causal reasoning short quiz; metacognitive reflection quality.
- Optional: Transfer task (new text/problem).

## Analysis
- Independent samples t-test or ANCOVA (pre as covariate).
- Report effect sizes (Cohen’s d) and inter-rater reliability.
