      <section>
        <h2>Empirical Grounding</h2>
        <p>
          One direction for future work is to operationalize components of the state $x = (q,m,r)$ and the emotional
          vector $E(t)$ using psychometric, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures. This would allow simplified Drift
          Theory models to be fit to longitudinal data, testing whether the proposed potentials and drift structure
          capture observed patterns of experiential change more effectively than simpler baselines.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Computational Simulations</h2>
        <p>
          Another direction is to implement computational simulations on low-dimensional toy manifolds, exploring how
          different choices of $\Phi$, $\Psi$, and $V$ generate distinct qualitative trajectories: stable relational
          patterns, oscillatory cycles, or chaotic exploration. Such simulations can provide intuition for how emotional
          wormholes and relational attractors interact in shaping lived experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Clinical and Narrative Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Drift Theory can function as a structured metaphor in psychotherapy and narrative work: helping to describe and
          potentially reframe life transitions as movements through experiential state-space, rather than as inexplicable
          breaks. This may support discussions of identity change, relational rupture, or recovery as dynamic processes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Philosophical Implications</h2>
        <p>
          Philosophically, Drift Theory engages with questions about personal identity over time, self-narrative, and the
          phenomenology of "alternative lives". By modeling experience as a drift through nearby versions of reality, it
          suggests that identity is formed not only by static traits but also by the shape of the trajectory and the
          attractor basins it repeatedly visits.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Interdisciplinary Position</h2>
        <p>
          Drift Theory should be understood as an interdisciplinary proposal: it draws mathematical tools from physics and
          dynamical systems, conceptual tools from philosophy and narrative theory, and empirical inspiration from
          psychology and neuroscience. It does not claim to revise fundamental physics; rather, it offers a more
          structured way to describe the multiverse-like character of subjective life.
