## What this page is
Form Foundry is a guided workspace to **replace an inherited ideal (“Form”)** with a ** humane, testable blueprint**. It leads you across five steps:
**Diagnose → Extract Essence → Reimagine → Embody → Share & Metrics**.  
Everything runs locally in your browser. No login, no server.

---

## Quick start (3 steps)
1. Click **“↓ Start forging”** → fill **Form Title** (required) and add short notes in each section.  
2. Hit **💾 Save Draft** — your draft appears in **Your Vault** (right rail).  
3. Export with **⬇ Export Markdown** (for docs) or **⬇ Export JSON** (for backups).  

> Tip: Use **🔗 Copy shareable URL** to generate a link that encodes your draft (in the URL hash). Anyone with that link can load it. Don’t share sensitive content this way.

## The five steps (what to write)

### 1) Diagnose the Inherited Form
- **Inherited Form:** Who authored this ideal? Who benefits? Where did you absorb it?
- **Harms & misfits:** How does it exhaust, exclude, or distort?
- **Signals it’s failing:** Frictions, contradictions, hypocrisies.

### 2) Extract the Essence
- **What’s worth preserving?** Distill durable value.
- **Context & constraints:** What’s true now that wasn’t then (e.g., remote work, attention economy, care duties)?

### 3) Reimagine the Blueprint
- **Definition (2–4 sentences):** Clear, positive, flexible (without vagueness).
- **Pillars (3–6):** Core principles.
- **Anti-patterns:** What this is **not** (traps to avoid).
- **Practices & rituals:** Small, repeatable behaviors.
- **Symbols & language:** Name, metaphors, visuals, shared vocabulary.

### 4) Embody & Ritualize
- **Roles & responsibilities:** Who does what? Feedback loops?
- **Friction plan (pre-mortem):** Where this might fail and your counter-moves.
- **Timeline:** Pilot → adopt → iterate (e.g., 30/60/90 days).

### 5) Share & Metrics
- **Audience & adoption:** Who needs to see/use this?
- **Success metrics:** Leading & lagging indicators that matter.
- **Ethics guardrails:** Consent, inclusion, transparency, non-negotiables.
- **License / attribution:** Defaults to **CC BY-SA 4.0 — Attribute ‘Forms Reforged — Shunya Publications’**.

## For a layperson (do it like this)
1. **Pick one Form** you’d like to change (e.g., “Success = constant output”).  
2. **Write 2–4 sentences** in each step. Don’t chase perfection — iterate.  
3. **Name 3–6 pillars** and **2–4 anti-patterns** (make trade-offs explicit).  
4. **Add 2–3 tiny rituals** you can do weekly/daily.  
5. **Decide roles & a 30/60/90-day timeline.**  
6. **Choose 3–5 metrics** that show humane progress (not vanity).  
7. **Save, export Markdown, and share** with your team/class.

## Example (you can adapt)

**Title:** Humane Success Model v1  
**Domain:** Work & Wellbeing  
**Author / Team:** M. A. K. Akhtar (Shunya)  
**Source / Links:** WHO burnout brief; internal OKR doc.

**1) Diagnose**  
- *Inherited:* “Success = constant output + visibility.” Learned via ranking systems and hustle norms; benefits loud contributors; absorbed via social feeds & OKRs.  
- *Harms:* Burnout, shallow work, exclusion of caregivers/introverts, performative metrics.  
- *Signals:* Weekend email creep, meeting overload, fear of saying “no,” vanity dashboards.

**2) Essence**  
- *Keep:* Craftsmanship, reliability, meaningful contribution to users.  
- *Context:* Remote/hybrid; attention fragmentation; care duties; async tools; health awareness.

**3) Reimagine**  
- *Definition:* Sustainable, high-leverage contribution that respects human limits and grows shared capability.  
- *Pillars:* Focus time · Useful outcomes · Health first · Learning loops · Fair visibility.  
- *Anti-patterns:* Always-on, heroics, vanity metrics, meeting-by-default.  
- *Rituals:* Two 90-min focus blocks/day; weekly “small wins”; Friday shutdown checklist.  
- *Symbols:* “Leverage > volume,” “Quiet wins,” “Green-battery days.”

**4) Embody**  
- *Roles:* Leads protect focus calendars; PMs propose async-first; HR tracks health signals.  
- *Friction plan:* Deadline spikes → flex pool; meeting creep → monthly audit; relapse → buddy check.  
- *Timeline:* 30d pilot → 60d rollout → 90d review.

**5) Share & Metrics**  
- *Audience:* Team, leadership, HR.  
- *Metrics:* % focus hours; lead time; sick days; satisfaction; rework rate.  
- *Ethics guardrails:* No coercive tracking; opt-in transparency; consent for sharing metrics.  
- *License / attribution:* CC BY-SA 4.0 — Attribute ‘Forms Reforged — Shunya Publications’.

## Quizzes (right rail)
- **Cave Flicker Check** — Are you living by shadows? Score to get a quick nudge.  
- **Ideal Integrity Gauge** — Will your new Form stay humane? Score to see gaps.

Use them as quick “sanity checks” during design.

## Privacy & data
- The app is **100% client-side**. Your drafts live in your **browser’s localStorage**.  
- Clearing site data, private browsing, or switching browsers/devices will **lose** local drafts unless you exported Markdown/JSON or kept the shareable link.  
- **Shareable links** contain your draft (Base64 in the hash). Anyone with the link can load it.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **My draft is gone.** You likely cleared site data or changed devices. Restore from your Markdown/JSON or the shareable link.  
- **Shareable link is too long to send.** Share the Markdown file instead.  
- **Markdown has no images/logos.** Export is text-only; attach images separately to your doc/deck.  
- **Vault doesn’t show a new entry.** Make sure **Form Title** is filled before **Save Draft**.
